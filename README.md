# Job Assistant
Find jobs given a ;inkedin profile and write a cover letter template for them.

This program uses LangChain, OpenAI, SERP API, and Apify to run the functions. 

To make this system run, enter your OpenAI API key, Apify API key, and SERP API key on the side bar. Then enter a LinkedIn profile URL and let the system do the rest. 

When clicking a checkbox for a recommended position, this will trigger the SERP API to find jobs on Google for that position. Opening each expander, you can read about the qualifications, benefits, and requirements for each job. Then, if you click on "Make Me a Cover Letter", it will load a Cover Letter template that you can review and edit for that position based on the experience of the LinkedIn Profile. 

NOTE: The Cover Letter is meant to act as a template and starting point, not as a final submission. You should edit and change the cover letter, as well as review, prior to submitting.
